What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?
* The name of the tech event that i attended was JavaScript Night, on Wednesday Feb. 28

Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?
* The organization that hosted us was Act On on 121 Morrison street. They Hosted Women who Code in Portland. There was a presentation which an Epicodus alumni gave about what women who code is all about and interesting things about her project that she's been working on. Alina an employee from Act On told everybody there what Act On was about and it was very interesting.

What was the format of the event?
* it was pretty fun they bought pizza and everybody ate, then we all introduced ourselves and got to know a little bit of each other. Lastly we got to listen to the presentation the coordinator  gave about women who code and cool things you could do with the console, and a project she was working on.

What was the topic or main focus of the event?
* The topic of the meetup was about JavaScript and getting to know a little bit more about it which i thought would be helpful since we start javascript again in two weeks.

What made you want to attend this particular event?
* what made me want to attend this meetup was that i wanted to refresh my memory of what i learned in intro since we start it next. i also though i could learn to use my the right terminology, which i did get to learn and use when we introduced ourselves. I also liked talking to other members and recommending epicodus to then so all of then can can get a chance to learn to code well and get a job as a programmer one day.

What was the highlight of the event?
* i think the highlight of the event was that everybody was friendly and it was actually fun to attend. I enjoyed getting to know what the program was about because i do believe all women and men should get to know about coding.

What did you learn from this experience?
* i leaned that there is a lot of young people who want to learn about coding which i liked because when i was in high school there was a few people that i knew like to code but most of my friends weren't interested in it. so, getting to come to the meet ups and meet young people who have the same goal in mind to learn to code well was something in enjoyed.

If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events do send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)
* If they could invite other programmers to see what their working on because that would be fun to know what programmers do for their work.

Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?
* I would because it wasn't boring there always something to learn about a language.

Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.
* I'm glad you gave us this opportunity to attend a meetup instead of doing the code review because i wouldn't never know how much i enjoyed the meetups. i will be attending more meetups that look interesting.
